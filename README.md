# Elfra

E-Learning Framework

## How to Install and Use:

To install and use our service, we use docker to containerize it.

> ### ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️
>
> Make sure you have [supabase setup]([www.supabase.com](https://github.com/Saftladen-Tech/Elfra/wiki/Supabase-Setup)) and created a ".env" file with the necessary environment variables.
> _You can use the ".env.example" file as a reference._

---

### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

> `docker compose build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".

To run the container now use this command:

> `docker compose up`
> \*This will start the latest Version used in docker compose

#### OR THIS

> <pre> docker run -d \
> &emsp; --name elfra-app \
> &emsp; -p 3000:3000 \
> &emsp; -v courses:/app/content/courses \
> &emsp; -v config:/app/customconfig \
> &emsp; -e NODE_ENV=production \
> &emsp; --restart unless-stopped \
> &emsp; elfra:1.0.0
> </pre>
> _Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0  
> 🚩 If you use this command you have to use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>` to stop it

Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

#### OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

---

### Method 2: Build and start it

To Build the current Version use the command:

> `docker compose up --build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag" and also starts it.

Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

#### OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

---

⚠️ With all methods the image and firsttime mounted volumes will always persist so you can use it later to build other instances!

---

Its importand to know that you will get 2 Volumes in docker:

📂: elfra_courses  
📂: elfra_config

#### elfra_courses

Here you can manage your WBTs and edit them. For now you have to make them by hand ([Tutorial](link)). Later they will be generated by the [Elfra Config Tool](https://github.com/Saftladen-Tech/Elfra-Config-Tool)

#### elfra_config

This folder is home to your config.ts file wich is beeing created and edited by the [Elfra Config Tool](https://github.com/Saftladen-Tech/Elfra-Config-Tool)
