# Elfra

E-Learning Framework

## How to Install and Use:

To install and use our service, we use docker to containerize it.

> IMPORTANT
> Make sure you have setup supabase and created a ".env" file with the necessary environment variables.
> You can use the ".env.example" file as a reference.

---

### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

> `docker compose build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".

To run the container now use this command:

> `docker compose up`
> \*This will start the latest Version used in docker compose

#### OR THIS

> `docker run Elfra:x.x.x`  
> _Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0  
> 🚩 If you use this command, you have to mount all folders yourself and use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>`

Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

#### OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

---

### Method 2: Build and start it

To Build the current Version use the command:

> `docker compose up --build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag" and also starts it.

Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

#### OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

---

⚠️ With all methods the image will always persist so you can use it later to build other instances!

Its importand to know that you will get 2 Volumes in docker:
