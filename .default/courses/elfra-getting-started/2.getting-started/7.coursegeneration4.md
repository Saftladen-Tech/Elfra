After you have configured these files you can add as many ".md" files to your topics as you want. They can be as long as you want and can have everything inside them that a ".md" file can process.

Since we use custom styling for some elements, we suggest you use these too. Currently there are two custom style. They are used for images and general styling.

- CCenter
- CImage

To use them, you need to wrap your content with them. Here is one example.:

<br>

**CCenter**

#### Code

```md
::CCenter
You can put anything inside here and its going to be centered!
::
```

#### Result

::CCenter
You can put anything inside here and its going to be centered!
::

<br>

**CImage**

#### Code

```md
::CImage
![example](https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg?_gl=1*1gewkzc*_ga*NjM1NjMzMDcwLjE3NTYyMDAyODA.*_ga_8JE65Q40S6*czE3NTYyMDAyODAkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTYyMDAzMDckajMzJGwwJGgw)
::
```

Its important to know that you can also manipulate the size of the image by adding a width and height parameter to the image tag. E.g.:

```md
::CImage
![example](*yourURL*){width=300 height=200}
::
```

Keep in mind, that if don't specify the size, the image would always be rendered in its original size!

#### Result

::CImage
![example](https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg?_gl=1*1gewkzc*_ga*NjM1NjMzMDcwLjE3NTYyMDAyODA.*_ga_8JE65Q40S6*czE3NTYyMDAyODAkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTYyMDAzMDckajMzJGwwJGgw){width=300 height=200}
