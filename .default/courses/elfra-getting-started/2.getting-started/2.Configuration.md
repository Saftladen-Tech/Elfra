To configure Elfra we have 2 main components. The courses and the general look and feel of the application.

After the setup of the container its importand to know that you will get 2 folder binds into the docker container:

ðŸ“‚: elfra_courses

ðŸ“‚: elfra_config

ðŸ“‚: elfra_data

#### elfra_courses

This folder is generated in your Home directory (~/elfra/courses) on first start of the container. Here you can manage your WBTs and edit them. For now you have to make them by hand (Tutorial). Later they will be generated by the Elfra Config Tool

#### elfra_config

This folder is generated in your Home directory (~/elfra/config) on first start of the container. This folder is home to your config.ts file wich is beeing created and edited by the Elfra Config Tool

These folder allow you to access and manage various Data wich elfra uses to work.

#### elfra_data

This folder is generated in your Home directory (~/elfra/data) on first start of the container. This folder is used to store all the public data like images, videos and other files you want to use in your courses. You can also use this folder to store user generated content if you allow that in your config.ts file.

Here you also place your company logos and fonts.

The Logo has to be named "logo.png" and the fonts have to be in a folder named "fonts" inside the data folder. You can then add the path in your config.ts with elfra config tool!
