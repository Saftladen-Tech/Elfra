### Using custom ressources!

If you want to use custom ressources like images, videos or other files, you can do this by making a folder for the course in the "courses" folder inside the data mount

Inside there you can then add your custom ressources. You can then link them in your ".md" files like this:

```md
![example](./Course-Name/yourfile.png)
```
