Inside the courses folder you will find all the courses you want to provide to your audience.

After the first start, the folder will be populated with a default course as an example. This course you can use as a baseline for you own or you can just deleted it.
Courses have a predefined structure, wich can not be generated automatically. For know you have to do everythink by hand.

Now you might ask yourself: "How do i do that ?". Good question. We will answer it in the next section!
