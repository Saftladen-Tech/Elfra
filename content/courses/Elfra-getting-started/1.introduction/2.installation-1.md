#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

Make sure you have [supabase setup](https://github.com/Saftladen-Tech/Elfra/wiki/Supabase-Setup) and created a ".env" file with the necessary environment variables. (The file needs to be created in the root directory)
_You can use the ".env.example" file as a reference/base._

We recommed to download the latest stable release and not use the main branch for your install!

#### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

üõë _Don't build the container if you haven't created the '.env' file with the correct variables yet!_

`docker compose build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".

To run the container now use this command
`docker compose up`
\*This will start the latest Version used in docker compose

OR THIS

```Shell
docker run -d
  --name elfra-app
  -p 3000:3000
  -v courses:/app/content/courses
  -v config:/app/customconfig
  -e NODE_ENV=production
  --restart unless-stopped
  elfra:1.0.0
```

_Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0  
üö© If you use this command you have to use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>` to stop it

Now you can stop/end the container by using

`docker compose stop`

_Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

`docker compose down`

!! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

#### Method 2: Build and start it

To Build the current Version use the command:

`docker compose up --build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag" and also starts it.

Now you can stop/end the container by using

`docker compose stop`

_Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

`docker compose down`

!! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

‚ö†Ô∏è With all methods the image and firsttime mounted volumes will always persist so you can use it later to build other instances!
