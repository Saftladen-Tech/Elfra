> #### ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

> Make sure you have [supabase setup](https://github.com/Saftladen-Tech/Elfra/wiki/Supabase-Setup) and created a ".env" file with the necessary environment variables. (The file needs to be created in the root directory)
> _You can use the ".env.example" file as a reference/base._

We recommed to download the latest stable release and not use the main branch for your install!

#### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

🛑 _Don't build the container if you haven't created the '.env' file with the correct variables yet!_
::

::CParagraph

> `docker compose build`
> ::
> ::CParagraph
> This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".
> ::
> ::CParagraph
> To run the container now use this command:

> `docker compose up`
> \*This will start the latest Version used in docker compose
> ::
> ::CParagraph
> OR THIS
> ::

::CParagraph

> ```Shell
> docker run -d
>   --name elfra-app
>   -p 3000:3000
>   -v courses:/app/content/courses
>   -v config:/app/customconfig
>   -e NODE_ENV=production
>   --restart unless-stopped
>   elfra:1.0.0
> ```
>
> _Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0  
> 🚩 If you use this command you have to use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>` to stop it
> ::
> Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

#### Method 2: Build and start it

To Build the current Version use the command:

> `docker compose up --build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag" and also starts it.

Now you can stop/end the container by using

> `docker compose stop`
> _Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

> `docker compose down`
> !! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

⚠️ With all methods the image and firsttime mounted volumes will always persist so you can use it later to build other instances!
