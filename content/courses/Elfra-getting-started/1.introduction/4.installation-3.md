#### Method 2: Build and start it

To Build the current Version use the command:

`docker compose up --build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag" and also starts it.

Now you can stop/end the container by using

`docker compose stop`
_Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

`docker compose down`
!! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!

---

⚠️ With all methods the image and firsttime mounted volumes will always persist so you can use it later to build other instances!
