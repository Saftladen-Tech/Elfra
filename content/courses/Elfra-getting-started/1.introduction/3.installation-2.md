#### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

ðŸ›‘ _Don't build the container if you haven't created the '.env' file with the correct variables yet!_
::

::CParagraph
`docker compose build`
::
::CParagraph
This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".
::
::CParagraph
To run the container now use this command
`docker compose up`
\*This will start the latest Version used in docker compose
::

::CParagraph
_Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0  
ðŸš© If you use this command you have to use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>` to stop it
::
::CParagraph
Now you can stop/end the container by usin
`docker compose stop`
_Keeps files and mounted volumes_
::
::CParagraph
OR
::
::CParagraph
`docker compose down`  
!! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!
