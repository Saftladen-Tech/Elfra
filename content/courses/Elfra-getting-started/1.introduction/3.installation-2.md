#### Method 1: Build it for later re-use of the Image

To Build the current Version use the command:

🛑 _Don't build the container if you haven't created the '.env' file with the correct variables yet!_

`docker compose build`

This builds the container under the name "Elfra" with the current version as "tag".

To run the container now use this command

`docker compose up`

This will start the latest Version used in docker compose

_Replace "x.x.x" with the version number of the tag you are installing._ E.g.: 1.0.0

🚩 If you use this command you have to use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>` to stop it

Now you can stop/end the container by using

`docker compose stop`

_Keeps files and mounted volumes_

OR

`docker compose down`

!! If you use "down" the container will also get removed !!
