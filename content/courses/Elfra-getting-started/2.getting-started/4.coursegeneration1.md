First you have to understand the structure of the course and how it works.
::

An Elfra course consists out of "Folders", "Markdownfiles" and ".navigation.yml" files.
::

::CParagraph
The folder are for the Main structure and the separation of Chapters and sections/topics
::

::CParagraph
The markdownfiles (.md) are used for your content. They can be filled with all markdown specific contentand can also be custom styled. For this we provide own classes/functions. We will talk about these later in the section
::

::CParagraph
And inside every folder we have a .navigation.yml file. As the name suggests, its used for navigation and metadata purposes. Its immportant to know, that we have two types! One for the main course and one for the chapters!

::CParagraph
The structure we need, looks like this:
::
::CParagraph
- Course Name
  - Topic 1
    - Content1 T1
    - Conten2 T1
  - Topic 2
    - Content1 T2
    - Conten2 T2
