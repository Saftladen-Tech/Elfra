After you have configured these files you can add as many ".md" files to your topics as you want. They can be as long as you want and can have everything inside them that a ".md" file can process.

Since we use custom styling for some elements, we suggest you use these too. Currently there is one custom style. Its used for images and their styling.

- CImage

To use it, you need to wrap your content with them. Here is one example.:

<br>
 
**CImage**
```md
::CImage
![example](https://images.pexels.com/photos/546819/pexels-photo-546819.jpeg?_gl=1*1gewkzc*_ga*NjM1NjMzMDcwLjE3NTYyMDAyODA.*_ga_8JE65Q40S6*czE3NTYyMDAyODAkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTYyMDAzMDckajMzJGwwJGgw)
::
```

Its important to know that you can also manipulate the size of the image by adding a width and height parameter to the image tag. E.g.:

```md
::CImage
![example](*yourURL*){width=300 height=200}
::
```
