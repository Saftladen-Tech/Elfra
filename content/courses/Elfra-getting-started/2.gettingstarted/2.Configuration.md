To configure Elfra we have 2 main components. The courses and the general look and feel of the application.
::

After the setup of the container its importand to know that you will get 2 folder binds into the docker container:

ðŸ“‚: elfra_courses
ðŸ“‚: elfra_config
ðŸ“‚: elfra_data (Coming soon!)

elfra_courses
This folder is generated in your Home directory (~/elfra/courses) on first start of the container. Here you can manage your WBTs and edit them. For now you have to make them by hand (Tutorial). Later they will be generated by the Elfra Config Tool

elfra_config
This folder is generated in your Home directory (~/elfra/config) on first start of the container. This folder is home to your config.ts file wich is beeing created and edited by the Elfra Config Tool

These folder allow you to access and manage various Data wich elfra uses to work.
