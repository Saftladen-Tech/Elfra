as stated in previous slide, we have a specific folder setup. Here we have a little example course, with all files:"
::
::CParagraph
- ğŸ“‚ Course-Name
  - ğŸ“‘ .navigation.yml
  - ğŸ“‚ 1.Topic_1
    - ğŸ“‘ .navigation.yml
    - ğŸ“„ 1.Content1_T1.md
    - ğŸ“„ 2.Conten2_T1.md
  - ğŸ“‚ 2.Topic_2
    - ğŸ“‘ .navigation.yml
    - ğŸ“„ 1.Content1_T2.md
    - ğŸ“„ 2.Conten2_T2.md

As you have seen on the example above, at the beginning of the "names" are numbers. We uses these to keep the files in the correct order! So dont forget them, if you do, your course could get scrambled up!
